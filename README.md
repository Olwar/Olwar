### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Shifting careers from a psychologist to a data scientist. My dream is to combine my three passions: People, data science and investments.

I've been working as a psychologist for the past couple of years, the last year as an psychologist entrepreneur. At the same time I've been studying programming and data science. Now Iâ€™m ready to take steps in a new direction and start a full-time job as a Data Scientist.
