### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Shifting careers from psychology to tech.

I've been working as a psychologist for the past couple of years, the last year as an psychologist entrepreneur. At the same time I've been studying software engineering and data science. Now Iâ€™m ready to take steps in a new direction and start a full-time job in tech.
